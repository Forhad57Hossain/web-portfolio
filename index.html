        <h2>These are legit in my opinion.</h2>
        <p>If “designer” is in the title, the job is designing. Literally deciding and implementing how websites look and work. “Web” is in the title because the job is specifically focused on the web. Specific skills would be design-tools-of-choice, HTML, CSS, and light JavaScript.

        If the job is also designing for print, apps, signage, products, clothing, etc., the title would be widened to Designer.</p>
